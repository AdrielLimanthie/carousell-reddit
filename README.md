# Carousell Reddit

This project is for making a website similar to Reddit, where users can submit topics and upvote or downvote them.

This project uses [React Redux Starter Kit](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit) as the foundation. I use this starter kit to quickly start making a working React application without wasting time for setting up a lot of modules needed in a React application. It contains ReactJS along with other useful tools for React development such as:

1. [Redux](http://redux.js.org/). A global state management library for JavaScript applications. 
1. [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/). A library to manage routes inside a React application.
1. [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). A CSS extension language to enhance & simplify CSS syntaxes.
1. [ESLint](http://eslint.org/). A customizeable linter for JavaScript.
1. [Babel](https://babeljs.io/). A plugin to compile ES6 into current available JavaScript syntaxes.
1. [Express](https://expressjs.com/). Run a server in NodeJS for a web application.
1. [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) Combine and build modules used in an application.

This list is only intended to highlight what I'm using inside this project. There are some other tools included that I do not mention here. To check out the complete tools included in this starter kit, you can visit the [React Redux Starter Kit Github Page](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit).

## Contribution Explanation

Most of the initial setups have been done by [React Redux Starter Kit](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit) including server configuration, dependencies management, routing, creating redux store, and many other things. Thus, in this section I will list the general file changes & addition I made to make this project as it is now.
